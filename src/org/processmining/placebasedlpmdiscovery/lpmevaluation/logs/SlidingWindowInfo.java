 * There are three different ways in which a current sliding window differs from the previous.
 * (1) Only adding an element: [a] -> [a b], [a b] -> [a b c]; This occurs when the sliding window capacity is not
 *  filled, i.e., at the beginning of a sequence. To see which activities have been added use
 * {@link #getAddedActivities()}.
 * (2) Removing and adding an element: [a b c] -> [b c b]; This occurs when the sliding window capacity is filled, so
 * first an element has to be removed and then added.
 * (3) Only removing an element: [b c b] -> [c b], [c b] -> [b]; This occurs when the sliding window is at the end of
 * a sequence. To see which activities have been removed use {@link #getRemovedActivities()}.
